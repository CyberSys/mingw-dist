      <description lang="en" title="msysCORE: The core components of MSYS">
        <paragraph>MSYS, or the Minimal SYStem, is a POSIX implementation
used in the Win32 operating system to enable configuration and compiling
of open-source packages. This package provides the main components of
MSYS, including the MSYS runtime DLL itself.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>MSYS is a fork of Cygwin and is more friendly to the
Win32 user. It offers only a user land environment for MinGW development.
It converts posix paths before executing a "native" win32 program. This
allows the users of the MinGW version of GCC to port and build packages
in a GNU familiar way and removes the UNIX complexities that Cygwin adds.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The MinGW/MSYS team provides additional packages
which contain utilities useful for this purpose, including perl, make,
autoconf, automake, libtool, m4, and many others.  However, the number
of such `MSYS packages' is limited in comparison to *nix or Cygwin, because
MSYS provides only the Minimal SYStem needed for hosting open source
development with the MinGW GCC compiler.  MSYS is not intended to replace
Cygwin, or emulate a full-fledged "port" of all *nix tools.</paragraph>
