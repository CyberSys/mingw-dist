      <description lang="en" title="gmp: The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library" >
        <paragraph>GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic,
          operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating
          point numbers.  It has a rich set of functions, and the functions
          have a regular interface.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The MinGW/MSYS project provides two gmp packages:
          the native win32 mingw32-gmp and an MSYS version, msys-gmp.
          mingw32-gmp is provided as a necessary component of modern MinGW
          gcc compilers, while the msys-gmp version requires the MSYS dll,
          and is provided as a prerequisite of certain other MSYS tools,
          such as guile.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The mingw32-gmp package provides the documentation
          for the gmp library, as well as the related development files.
          The associated mingw32-libgmp package provides the C runtime
          library, while the associated mingw32-libgmpxx package provides
          the C++ runtime library.
