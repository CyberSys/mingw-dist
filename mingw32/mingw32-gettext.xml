        <paragraph>GNU gettext provides a set of tools that create a
          framework to help other GNU packages produce multi-lingual
          messages. In this way, with suitable care a single binary
          application can automatically provide user messages (such as
          `help' text) in the language corresponding to the current
          locale settings.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The gettext package provides utilities that may
          be useful to end-users, allowing interaction with the message
          translation database of other i18n-enabled GNU utilities. It
          also provides the development libraries, header files, and
          documentation for the gettext system, as well as additional
          utilities useful for maintainers of i18n-enabled applications.
          The *-ext package provides extra documentation, in the form of
          example implementations in many different computer languages.
          The associated libgettextpo package provides the runtime
          libraries needed by the gettext utilities; the associated
          libasprintf package provides the runtime library for the
          asprintf utility library; and finally, the associated libintl
          package provides the runtime component of the internationalization
          library itself.
