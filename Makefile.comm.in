@mingw_ac_subdirs@: all

# We use an automatically generated Makefile.sub to manage the list
# of distributable files, ensuring that we automatically capture all
# XML files in the source directory, and converting them to serialised
# LZMA compressed format for upload to the repository server.

# Distributed manifests are serialised by incorporating a date-stamped
# issue number, of the form YYYYMMDDNN; we track issue numbers using the
# issue.log file, (which we keep in CVS to ensure that all maintainers
# can share a common issue number registry).

# Formatting within issue.log is controlled by PAD and TAB settings.
#
TAB = [	 ]
PAD = "  "

# The following generic rule processes an XML source template, inserting
# the appropriate issue number, and compressing to yield the required LZMA
# distribution manifest.  The generated issue number which gets applied is
# appropriately serialised relative to the original record for the  source
# XML file being processed, as noted in the local copy of issue.log, which
# is then updated to record the new issue number; to avoid any regression
# of issue numbers, all maintainers are advised to update issue.log from
# CVS immediately prior manifest generation, and to commit back as soon
# as possible thereafter; any ensuing conflict must be resolved before
# any updated manifest is uploaded to the repository server.
